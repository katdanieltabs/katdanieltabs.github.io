[Intro]

E G#m D A F#m E F#m A

E G#m D A F#m E F#m A

Ooh

 

[Verse]

E                      F#m

Activity’s killing the actor

      B                         A     F#m              D   B

And a cop’s standing out in the road, turning traffic away

E                                     F#m

There was nothin’ she could do until after

         B                     A   F#m             D   B

When his body’d been buried below, way back in the day

 

[Chorus]

C#m C#m7 C#m                          A

Oh my, nothing else could have been done

E        E/D#   C#m A   Dmaj7

Made his life a lie so

C#m C#m7 C#m                   A

He might never have to know anyone

E        E/D#     C#m     A     Dmaj7

Made his life the lie you know

 

[Verse]

E                              F#m

I told him that he shouldn’t upset her (ooh)

              B                 A     F#m                D      B

And that he’d only be making it worse involving somebody else (ooh)

E                             F#m

But I knew that he’d never forget her (ooh)

          B                   A       F#m                   D      B

While her memory worked in reverse to keep her safe from herself (ooh)

 

[Chorus]

    C# C#m7 C#m                          A

And oh my, nothin’ else could have been done

E   E/D#     C#m    A      Dmaj7

She made her life a lie so (ooh)

C#m C#m7   C#m                  A

She might never have to know anyone

E        E/D#      C#m    A    Dmaj7

Made her life the lie you know

 

[Instrumental]

E G#m D A F#m E F#m A

 

[Outro]

E    G#m D          A    F#m   E        F#m        A

What I   used to be will pass away and then you’ll see

     E   G#m  D   A      F#m  E        F#m     A

That all I   want now is happiness for you and me

E    G#m D      A       F#m    E      F#m          A

What I  used to be will pass away and then you’ll see

     E   G#m D    A      F#m   E       F#m     A

That all I  want now is happiness for you and me

E    G#m D       A       F#m  E        F#m         A

What I  used to be will pass away and then you’ll see

     E   G#m D   A      F#m  E        F#m     A

That all I want now is happiness for you and me

E   G#m D    A      F#m   E       F#m     A

All I  want now is happiness for you and me

E G#m D A F#m E F#m A

E G#m D A F#m E F#m A
