this is exactly the same as the original except all the chords

have been moved up a semitone, so that none of the chords

specifically have to be barred. if you want you can tune your

guitar down half a step to acheive the sound on the record.

 

 

[Verse 1]

 

G                                     C              G

Elope with me Miss Private and we’ll sail around the world

Am                            Em

I will be your Ferdinand and you my wayward girl

     Am                          D

How many nights of talking in hotel rooms can you take?

     Am                             D

How many nights of limping round on pagan holidays?

      C                               Em

Oh elope with me in private and we’ll set something ablaze

   Am            D         Em

A trail for the devil to erase

 

 

[Verse 2]

 

G                               C                    G

San Francisco’s calling us, the Giants and Mets will play

Am                                Em

Piazza, New York catcher, are you straight or are you gay?

   Am                            D

We hung about the stadium, we’ve got no place to stay

   Am                            D

We hung about the tenderloin and tenderly you tell

          C                              Em

About the saddest book you ever read, it always makes you cry

    Am              D               Em

The statue’s crying too and well he may

 

 

[Verse 3]

 

  G                                C            G

I love you I’ve a drowning grip on your adoring face

  Am                      Em

I love you my responsibility has found a place 

  Am                                  D

Beside you and strong warnings in the guise of gentle words

     Am                          D

Come wave upon me from the family wider net absurd

             C                                Em

“You’ll take care of her, I know it, you will do a better job”

Am         D              Em

Maybe, but not what she deserves

 

 

[Verse 4]

 

  G                                  C               G

Elope with me Miss Private and we’ll drink ourselves awake

      Am                            Em

We’ll taste the coffee houses and award certificates

  Am                             D

A privy seal to keep the feel of 1960 style

      Am                             D

We’ll comment on the decor and we’ll help the passer by

       C                               Em

And at dusk when work is over we’ll continue the debate

     Am               D             Em

In a borrowed bedroom virginal and spare

 

 

[Verse 5]

 

    G                         C             G

The catcher hits for .318 and catches every day

    Am                              Em

The pitcher puts religion first and rests on holidays

   Am                            D

He goes into cathedrals and lies prostrate on the floor

   Am                                     D

He knows the drink affects his speed he’s praying for 

A doorway

       C                                Em

Back into the life he wants and the confession of the bench

Am               D            Em

Life outside the diamond is a wrench

 

 

[Verse 6]

 

  G                                  C             G

I wish that you were here with me to pass the dull weekend

  Am                                Em

I know it wouldn’t come to love, my heroine pretend

  Am                              D

A lady stepping from the songs we love until this day

      Am                          D

You’d settle for an epitaph like “Walk Away, Renee”

          C                               Em

The sun upon the roof in winter will draw you out like 

A flower

 

Am              D            Em

Meet you at the statue in an hour

Am              D            Em

Meet you at the statue in an hour
