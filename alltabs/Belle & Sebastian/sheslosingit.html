Intro :  G Am  x3   G   (bar chords)

 

G                        Am

Lisa knows a girl who's been abused

   G                         Am

It changed her philosophy in '82

      D              C

She's always looking for a fight

    D

She keeps the neighbours up all night.

 

G                    Am

I go to her when I'm feeling slack

    G                     Am

The girl is using me as a punching bag

  D                  C

I think that I could help her out

        D

But the girls got alot to be mad about

 

CHORUS

           C                D

But in the first moment of waking up

                        Em                Am

        she knows she's losing it, she's losing it

          C                              D

When the first cup of coffee tastes like washing up,

                         Em                       Am

        she knows she's losing it, oh yeah she's losing it,

                               C

                oh yeah she's losing it.

 

G Am D C x4

 

G                       Am

Lisa met Chelsea at the knocking school

G                             Am

Chelsea didn't feel like following the rules

    D                  C

She left the place for another school

      D

Where boys go with boys and the girls with girls

 

G                       Am

Chelsea wasn't one who's been abused

    G                         Am

She changed her philosophy in '82

         D                  C

She says inch for pinch and pound for pound

D

Who needs boys when there's Lisa around?

 

           C                D

But in the first moment of waking up

                        Em                Am

        she knows she's losing it, she's losing it

          C                              D

When the first cup of coffee tastes like washing up,

                         Em                       Am

        she knows she's losing it, oh yeah she's losing it,

    C                         D

She goes to the mirror to put on her stuff,

                        Em                Am

        she knows she's losing it, oh yeah she's losing it

    C                            D

She doesn't speak to anyone till 4 o'clock

                          Em                       Am

        she's knows she's losing it, oh yeah she's losing it, oh yeah she's losing it.
